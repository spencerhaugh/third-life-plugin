# Third Life Plugin

## Game rules: 
Players are expected to be peaceful until reaching their "Red life".  
However, griefing and theft is encouraged on any lives, as alliances are formed (or broken).  

Players deaths are tracked, and when a player has 3 deaths they are eliminated from the game,  
forced into spectator mode.  

0 deaths names are Green, and are peaceful.  
1 death player names are Yellow, and are peaceful.  
2 death player names are Red, and these "Red life" players are no longer required to be  
peaceful and may pvp or trap any other players. However, "Red name" player also  
can no longer have alliances with non-red players.
